## Introduction

This is a simple online shopping page demo built using HTML and CSS (without Bootstrap or JavaScript). It is designed to demonstrate a clean and responsive layout suitable for an e-commerce website. The page features a product listing, navigation bar, and footer, all styled using pure HTML and CSS.

- Product Display: Products are displayed with images, names, prices, and descriptions.

- Navigation Bar: Includes links to navigate between sections.

- Footer: Contains footer content with social media links.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5: Used to structure the webpage.

- CSS3: For styling, including Flexbox for layout and Media Queries for responsiveness.
- Flexbox: Used to create the product grid and layout the page in a flexible manner.

- Media Queries: Ensures that the page adjusts properly to different screen sizes.
